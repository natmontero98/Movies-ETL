# Movies-ETL
The Amazing Prime team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies will become popular, so they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain. The company decided to sponsor a Hackathon. A hackathon is an event where teams of analysts collaborate to work intensively on a project, using data to solve a problem, so it is of great importance to provide them with a clean dataset.

In this project, we're helping Britta perform an ETL process to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database for the hackathon participants. 

The process we followed is:
**Extract** the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, **transform** the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and **load** the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
